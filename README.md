# Feasibility Study with Foregone Conclusion
 EGAT announced near the end of 2007 that they are allocating 138,000,000,000
baht (over 43 million dollars) to conduct a feasibility study to see whether nuclear
power plants are the best option for generating Thailand‘s future electricity needs. To
add legitimacy to the study, they got the Thai government to form a proxy entity
called Nuclear Power Development office (NPDO) to stand alongside. Since EGAT
is a government enterprise, it‘s run differently than a corporation. One of those
differing ways is to allocate vast amounts of money for a campaign to produce a
foregone conclusion. Actually, it‘s similar to what a private corporation would do,
though a corporation would call it marketing,‘ whereas EGAT calls it a feasibility
study.‘
 "Building a nuclear power plant is unavoidable for Thailand."

 Tara Buakamsri, a Greenpeace campaigner, says, ―Amongst many fast-tracked
decisions taken by the erstwhile military-government, the approval of 1.38 billion
baht to study nuclear power generation by Mr. Piyasvasti Amranand (former energy
minister), on his last day in the office, is a huge waste of money and will not
adequately address the real issue of energy security.
 Those in the highest echelons of Thai government want nuclear power. They‘ve
already expressed that desire unequivocally. The reasons are manifold and will be
discussed later. The point here is that the allocation of 1.38 billion baht is a complete
waste of taxpayer/ratepayer‘s money, because it‘s earmarked for a result that‘s preordained. Actually, much of the money will get spent on high quality printed brochures which will likely be distributed nationwide. Another sizable portion will
get spent on TV and radio ad spots.
 Why all the expensive brochures and TV spots? The answer: To convince the
Thai public that nuclear is the best option to meet Thailand‘s future electricity needs.
To get an idea of how easily the general Thai populace is swayed by publicity:
Just after the turn of the century, there was a nationwide election. One party spent
gargantuan amounts on printing slick campaign posters which they hung everywhere.
Nearly every one of the millions of concrete power poles throughout Thailand had a
poster hanging from it (which is technically illegal, but who cares when the hanger is
rich and powerful?). The other party had a much smaller number of posters hung. 
Guess who won the election? It‘s a no-brainer, the party with the steamroller
campaign won handsomely.
 One party made all sorts of promises, having to do with forgiving debts, and
offering nearly free health care. No matter that when that party won, the debt
forgiveness plan went awry and hospitals closed for lack of funds. All that mattered
was saying what need to be said to get elected.
 One party had a giant campaign that paid village headmen to pass payments down
to voters. Some observers say that the vote-buying was the most effective policy of
all – and it certainly cemented the well-funded party‘s avalanche of votes. The nuclear
debate‘ within Thailand will involve money also – lots of it - and there‘s no mystery
who will have the most baht to spend to pursue their agenda.
 Where does the money come from? The 1.38 billion baht for the ‗feasibility study‘
which EGAT (Electric ity Generating Authority of Tha iland) is allocating to the
newly formed NPDO (Nuclear Power Development Office)? Perhaps that‘s a two or
three pronged question. For starters, how much is Thai government (taxpayers), and
how much from EGAT‘s rate-payers. It‘s not from corporate coffers because EGAT
is not a private corporation, so the feasibility study‘ will be paid for by the public,
either through taxes and/or through higher electricity bills.
 EGAT won‘t ask corporate bidders to contribute to their campaign to market
nuclear, at least not openly. Since the money EGAT will be spending is government
money, then there‘s scant incentive to get creative with the financing of their
feasibility study‘ or any other expenses. Plus it takes more effort to solicit
cooperation from outside corporations, and EGAT would likely rather take the course
of least effort.
 If EGAT‘s proposed feasibility study‘ were really looking at the feasibility of
nuclear, it would, by definition, look at other electricity generating options. There has
been, and will continue to be some lip service paid to some alternatives, yet the
conclusion is foregone – the boys at the top all want nuclear, so any mention of
alternative options will be like window dressing – in order to make it appear they‘re
being objective.
